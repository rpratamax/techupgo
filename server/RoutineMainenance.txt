Care and Feeding of the Blockly Games Server.

Routine system maintenance (suggest monthly):
SSH to the server (for Googlers, look this up in Pantheon's Virtual Server tab).
Once connected, issue the following commands:
> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade

To push a new version of Blockly Games:
> sudo su - bg-user
>   cd blockly-games
>   git pull
>   make  # Watch this step to ensure no errors!
>   make deploy
>   exit
Immediately test http://blockly.games to verify nothing broke.

If there are updates to the web server config:
> sudo cp ~bg-user/blockly-games/server/blocklygames.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
> sudo nginx -s reload

To access the admin page, point a web browser at: https://blockly.games/admin
Although the admin page doesn't require authentication, many of the pages it
links to do.  The username is 'admin', and the password (if you are a Googler)
is found in Valentine.

As of April 2024 the gallery moderation is not usable due to team priorities.
